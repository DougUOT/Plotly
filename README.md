# Plotly
Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons and then deploy the dashboard to a cloud server.

## Overview of Project

In this module, we will create data visualizations for the web. In order to interact with data, our audience usually needs to have Python installed on their computer. In this module, we will use JavaScript to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. We will use Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library. We will also build our JavaScript foundation to manipulate pass and transform data. We will use javascript to create interactive features such as buttons and dropdown menus and retrieve data from external sources like .csv files and API. To the end, we will deploy a polished data visualization to the web.
